If you want to initialize the repository with code, let me know the programming language (e.g., Python, Go, Rust) or specific features (e.g., smart contracts, node implementation), and I can provide sample code.

If youâ€™d like to generate a logo or diagram for the Sophon Network (e.g., for the README), confirm if you want me to create one using image generation tools.

If you need to analyze existing GitHub repositories with the sophon-network topic, I can search GitHub for relevant repositories and summarize their content.
